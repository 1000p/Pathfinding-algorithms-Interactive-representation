# Pathfinding-algorithms-Interactive-representation
The project is my try in interactively visualize pathfinding algorithms.
The initial intentions where only to explore **pathfinding**, but later I realized that those algorithms did not had a play ground, so I extended it to include **maze generation algorithms**

I have tried to focus first on "the most popular" choises - later those can be really easily extended via inheriting an interface. In section [Feature Plans](#feature-plans) we will cover what I want to add next.

## Features
Currently the project supports the visualisation of:
- A* algorithm

## Feature Plans
Pathfinding algorithms to be added in preceedance order:
- [Flow Fields](https://leifnode.com/2013/12/flow-field-pathfinding/) - I really want to explore the implementation of **"Flow Flied"** as it is something bit different
- [Any-Angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any-angle_path_planning)
- [Djikstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
- [Greedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm)
- [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
- [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
